* Little information on education or age
* <q>Hard-working</q>, <q>responsible</q>

## Incident

<div style="position: absolute" v-click="0" v-click.hide="1" v-motion :initial="{x: 0}" :enter="{x: 0}" :leave="{x: -80}">

* Phineas Gage was detonating holes in a mountain
  * System of gunpowder (to trigger explosion) plus sand (to absorb shockwave)
  * The stack was struck with a metal pole to trigger the gunpowder
* He was distracted while filling up a hole for detonation
* Due to this distraction, he forgot the sand, which meant nothing was absorbing the force

</div>

<div v-click="1" v-motion :initial="{x: 80}" :enter="{x: 0}" :leave="{x: 0}">

<img v-click="2" style="float: right; max-width: 40%" src="./skull.png" />

* The explosion launched his iron into his head
* Pierced his skull and brain
* His frontal lobe was severely damaged

</div>

## Effects

* Early observations were taken by Gage's friend, John Harlow:

> The equi­lib­rium or balance, so to speak, between his intel­lec­tual fac­ul­ties and animal pro­pen­si­ties, seems to have been destroyed. He is fitful, irreverent, indulging at times in the grossest profanity (which was not pre­vi­ous­ly his custom), manifesting but little deference for his fellows, impatient of restraint or advice when it conflicts with his desires, at times per­ti­na­cious­ly obstinate, yet capricious and vac­il­lat­ing, devising many plans of future operations, which are no sooner arranged than they are abandoned in turn for others appearing more feasible. A child in his intel­lec­tu­al capacity and man­i­fes­ta­tions, he has the animal passions of a strong man. Previous to his injury, although untrained in the schools, he possessed a well-balanced mind, and was looked upon by those who knew him as a shrewd, smart business man, very energetic and persistent in executing all his plans of operation. In this regard his mind was radically changed, so decidedly that his friends and acquaint­ances said he was "no longer Gage."

* Gage was able to move and function relatively quickly
* Gage eventually returned to normal social behavior

---

## Aftermath

* Gage moved to Chile and held down a stagecoach job
  * Being a stagecoach required having a good personality:
    > \[Drivers should\] be reliable, resourceful, and possess great endurance. But above all, they had to have the kind of personality that enabled them to get on well with their passengers.
* Gage eventually died during a seizure (1860-05-21)

Mention Gage's job requiring good personality

## Contributions

* Demonstrated brain locality
* Helped prove brain plasticity

<!--
brain locality - the fact that certain parts of the brain do certain things
brain plasticity - ability to repair / modify from damage

## Misconceptions

<!-- this code is bullshit -->

<ul>
<disproved>
    Gage's personality was permanently changed by his injury.
    <template #disproof>
        Evidence suggests Gage made a near-complete recovery to his former self within a few years. 
    </template>
</disproved>
<disproved>
    Gage mistreated his wife and children
    <template #disproof>
        True only vacuously &mdash; Gage had no wife or children
    </template>
</disproved>
<disproved>
    Gage had difficulty holding down work after his injury.
    <template #disproof>
        Gage led a relatively normal life after his injury, and was able to hold jobs. He only had difficulty holding down work shortly before he died.
    </template>
</disproved>
</ul>
