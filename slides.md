## Incident

<div style="position: absolute" v-click="0" v-click.hide="1" v-motion :initial="{x: 0}" :enter="{x: 0}" :leave="{x: -80}">

* Phineas Gage was detonating holes in a mountain
  * System of gunpowder (to trigger explosion) plus sand (to absorb shockwave)
  * The stack was struck with a metal pole to trigger the gunpowder
* He was distracted while filling up a hole for detonation
* Due to this distraction, he forgot the sand, which meant nothing was absorbing the force

</div>

<div v-click="1" v-motion :initial="{x: 80}" :enter="{x: 0}" :leave="{x: 0}">

    </template>
</disproved>
<disproved>
    Gage mistreated his wife and children
    <template #disproof>
        True only vacuously &mdash; Gage had no wife or children
    </template>
</disproved>
<disproved>
    Gage had difficulty holding down work after his injury.
    <template #disproof>
        Gage led a relatively normal life after his injury, and was able to hold jobs. He only had difficulty holding down work shortly before he died.
